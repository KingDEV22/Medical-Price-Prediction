# Medical Price Prediction

Medical Price Prediction is a machine learning project that aims to predict the medical prices of an individual based on specific criteria. The project utilizes various regression algorithms to train predictive models and provides insights into the relationships between different attributes of the data through graphs and plots.

## Features

The Medical Price Prediction project offers the following key features:

- **Machine Learning Model**: The project employs machine learning techniques to develop predictive models for estimating medical prices. By training on historical data, the models can make accurate predictions based on the provided criteria.

- **Regression Algorithms**: Various regression algorithms, such as linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression, are implemented in the project. These algorithms capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data to generate predictions.

- **Data Visualization**: The project leverages graphs and plots to visualize the relationships between different attributes and the predicted medical prices. This visual representation aids in understanding the impact of various factors on medical costs.
